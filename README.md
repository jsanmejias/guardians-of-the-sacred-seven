## Project Overview  
*Guardians of the Sacred Seven* is an educational game designed to teach the value of **Respect**, inspired by the buffalo from the Seven Sacred Teachings. The game combines engaging mechanics with meaningful education, offering players a fun yet purposeful experience.  

## Scope  
The game is a modern take on the classic *Snake* game, featuring a single level where players guide a character to collect buffalo tokens in a grassy field. The player's progress is tracked through a progress bar, and the level concludes with an educational pop-up describing the theme.  

### Key Features  
- **Gameplay:**  
  - Players control a non-gender-specific character that moves automatically, changing direction with arrow keys.  
  - Collecting buffalo tokens increases the character's trail by three units and speeds up movement.  
  - Obstacles reduce progress by 20% and increase speed by 1.25%.  
  - Tokens contribute 10% to the progress bar; once full, the level ends with an educational pop-up.  

- **Design Elements:**  
  - **Main Menu**: Includes the game title and a start button, navigated using mouse clicks.  
  - **Visuals**: A grassy field serves as the background, creating an immersive setting.  
  - **Audio**: Indigenous-themed background music enhances the experience.  

- **Educational Theme:**  
  - The buffalo represents Respect from the Seven Sacred Teachings.  
  - At the end of the level, an educational pop-up explains the teaching, which players can close to proceed to the credits.  

- **Additional Details:**  
  - A credits screen provides references for images and information used in the game.  

## Deliverables  
A polished and functional game will be delivered by the established completion date, showcasing principles of project management, teamwork, and cultural respect.
